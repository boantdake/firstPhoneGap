Mobile application with PhoneGap this is the first in a series of PhoneGap applications I will be posting on here. I will employ the following technologies while making my applications.
LAMP Stack
JS, Nodejs, HTML5, Android SDK, Android Studio, ADB via Linux,Sublime Text 3,Phonegap,Git,AngularJS,Bootstrap 3, jQuery MobileJava JDK 8
FireBase (document database “cloud”) for CRUD from app to database.

You will actually have to have the phonegap base files for this to work like its supposed to, the files I didnt upload where the android base files.
